## Vision

Riggr is a cross-platform robotics desktop tool that makes common workflows (launch, inspect, record, debug) approachable and repeatable.

Key principles:
- UI is **thin**; orchestration lives in a local agent.
- ROS support is **adapted** via a separate process boundary.
- Robotics-general (AGV/arm/drone/boat) via capability profiles, not hard-coded assumptions.
